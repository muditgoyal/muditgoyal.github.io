    Can't get over with how upsetting it was that even though @kwuchu and I won a game in @PlayApex, the rando on our team was swearing the whole time, calling everything bitches and fuck boys, and being aggressive towards me in game for no reason. I just wanted to leave the game ASAP. :( might be why I got the winning kill tho I was so on edge. Can gamer boys grow up? (no 😔)

    I was shocked to see more and more Taiwanese people, who know little about US politics, liking the GOP and people like Ted Cruz. Then I recently found out it is because they are the ones in the US Congress lifting Taiwan’s status up for the democratic nation it is, inviting President Tsai to visit and speak against PRC’s wishes, pushing for bills to establish official relationships between the US and Taiwan. Intentions matter, but what can Taiwanese people take from the silence of the Dems?

As for group travel, the country would end up being the silent host whose presence one forgets like one does an overly timid guest, the principal subject becoming the backdrop.
